         <p>When a player lands on a "S" space, they shall be safe from all actions. (eg. if an enemy player lands is in the act of taking a point from a
            player,you will not be able to be targeted)</p>

         <h1>Z-Space</h1>

         <p>When a player lands on a Z space, all players shall move back X spaces, determined by the number rolled on the dice. Only the player who rolled the
            dice will have the ending space effect applied.(eg. If you rolled a 4, and landed on a "Z" space, all players will move back 4 spaces. If you now
            land on a -2, you will lose 2 points. All other players ONLY have their position effected.)</p>

         <p>This project, <b>OVERTHRONE</b> is a party style board game with a set amount of turns determined by the player(s). Your main objective is to
            end the game with the greatest number of points. Players will roll a die to determine the order of play. Each player will take turns rolling dice.
            The number rolled on the dice is the total number of spaces the player will move. After a player moves, they will preform an action based on the space
            that they land on, and then that player's turn is ended. After the last player's turn has ended, a random minigame will start, giving all player's the
            opportunity to receive more points through their skills. If a player reaches an endpoint on the map, their position will be reset at a random stating position.</p>
